A peculiar sight can be a harrowing sight, especially in cases where consistency and perfection are the virtues of the day, and this has never been more true than in the case of Javascript. The sights of scarecrows and signs plastered with lettering stating, "Beware, all ye who type cast", haunt the minds of Javascript developers whose experiences with type safety have left scars deep within the recesses of their minds. Typescript itself offers a notable respite from the usual unintended effects of not knowing what kinds of data may enter a given system. Typescript allows developers to declare types ahead of their use in variables and functions thereby protecting the consistency and determinacy of their cherished applications.   

As Javascript programmers cradled their children at the night - relishing the memories of times and terror gone by - scarcely has the horror of the second and third "=" sign left their lips. As one can easily imagine, many programmers to be champing at the bit for a better paradigm and language  - something like Typescript that could provide comfort through its handling of type safety. Now, with its distinct declarations of string and number as well as a significant flexibility in declaring types, one can find solace that their application will behave in a fixed and repeatable manner.  

## My Own Struggles And Considerations 

I, too, can find a sense of respite in the realm of programming. Over the course of my college career, I have found myself learning numerous programming languages including C/C++, MIPS Assembly, Java and even hardware design languages such as Verilog. Having spent a considerable amount of time learning and applying a wide array of skills and toolsets, it is nice to have yet another thing to learn about from a basic skill level and sate my curiosity. In many ways, the wealth of documentation and information found online leads to Typescript and web development in general to be a much more approachable subject than embedded programming. As a result, I take a great deal of comfort in this. 

When comparing to my prior experiences, the Typescript labs have been very forgiving and lend themselves to quick learning. Frankly, I am deeply greatful about not having to worry about allocating memory, whether to declare a variable as a wire or a register, or the size of a data type. 
Yet, I do find myself struggling with programming under a time limit when the syntax is so fresh in my mind. This has been my chief grievance in the course so far - that is, transitioning from one style of programming to a more agile kind.

## Developing As An Engineer

Currently, I look forward to the athletic software engineering that this class structure has been advertising across its many modules. Personally, I believe that I will gain the confidence and relevant skills to work on professional code as a result of working in this class. However, time will yet tell, and I do have concerns regarding the retention of material after the course has ended. I imagine that with so many materials, it will be difficult to keep track of the previous ground covered. 

On a positive note, I find that the practice WODS are fantastic as the little competitions they present are fun in their own way. I also find them highly relevant to my career. Specifically, I am referring to the interview questions that are asked for software developer positions while under strict time pressure implicit to an interview. I can imagine that this will be an incredible boon to me as I advance in my career, and that this class can even provide tools that I may use in the future. When looking towards the future, I am excited for my path into web development - with all of its winding and twisting.
