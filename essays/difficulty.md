Offering both unparalleled ease of use and readability, these rarely unsung virtues find themselves manifested in none other than Typescript itself. For years, Javascript programmers often found themselves frantic with frustration and fraught with fear when saddled with maintaining a codebase built by predecessors of years gone by. 

Many horrors were found between a second and third “=” sign, or at least, those were the tales I’ve heard. This led many programmers to be champing at the bit for a better paradigm and language  - something like Typescript that could provide comfort through its handling of type safety. 

## My Own Struggles And Considerations 

Similarly, I find myself also in a state of gratitude of having transitioned towards a new language to learn. As a result of having spent the last year learning C, Verilog, and MIPS assembly language -  I found myself remarkably fatigued. Thus, this outlines the contrast of my experience with many Javascript developers.

I have been so entrenched with incredibly strict and low level languages over the past year that this recent transition has brought many boons and struggles. Admittedly, it has been a wonderful experience not having to worry about allocating memory, whether to declare a variable as a wire or a register, or the size of a data type.

However, I have often found myself struggling with programming under time pressure especially with syntax that is not deeply ingrained in me. This has been my major difficulty in the course so far - that is, adapting from one style of programming to a more fast and loose kind.

## Developing As An Engineer

Yet, I still look forward to the athletic software engineering that this class structure is hoping to provide. It seems to me that this will result in me becoming a much more well-rounded programmer, and I think that I will be confident with this style of programming given enough time. 

The practice WODS have been very helpful in getting me back up to speed in more traditional coding exercises. Specifically, I am referring to the interview questions that are asked for software developer positions. It is important to remember that there is not always time for long and critical thought - a philosophy that I believe this class enforces and maintains. 

I can imagine that this will be nothing but a great help to me as I advance in my career, and I am excited for my path into web development - with all of its winding and twisting.
