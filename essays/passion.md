I've always enjoyed art in all its forms. When I was a kid, I used to read 10 books between every two weeks to my trips to the library. Now, my Spotify playlists reach thousands of songs, my to-do lists consist of primarily shows and movies I have yet to watch, and now my Steam wishlist contains hundreds of games. Indeed, all of this is without any hyperbole. I used to pace back and forth in my room when I was a kid - imagining how I would write the next page in a book I had just put down. All my life, I have been hoarding pictures and words with ideas about what comes next pulsing in the back of my mind. In a self-deprecating manner, I often joke with my friends that I am a modern patron of the arts with how much of my wallet goes towards things that other people make. Frequently, I feel that people don't appreciate what it means to enjoy and consume the things that others make. In contrast, there is a constant desire to make and produce - to demand the attention of the invisible room that stretches across the many minds of your audience. But, we are left forgetting the wonder that one can feel when they are enraptured by the darling of another mind, or the interminable heartache of when a door is shut on a world you could never know - leaving you in relentless pursuit across the corridor of your imagination for that very next door back in.  

I think it is only when we know this feeling all too well that we can design things that people remember fervently, or that we can really be driven to make things at all. These stirrings of emotion cut through the mundane, and even very simple projects can become bigger than you know with those seeds of passion. However, it is often said that ideas are cheap and execution is everything. Yet, I posit that execution can only be done through the relentless search of all those prior ideas - an examination of those half-done abandoned projects that people cared dearly for at one time. Engineering is as much about memory and appreciating as it is about creating. People call this research, but those more prone to flowery prose would call it reminscing. These memories lead us to think about constraints and ideas that might matter no longer, heated discussions that may never be heard again, and the stressful times felt by none other than the first to do it.

In this Software Engineering class (and I hope in much of my Computer Engineering degree), I would love to get a sense of the times before and how they led to the problems of "Now". Wherever my career might take me, I want to gain the skills that are required to learn from those mistakes of history, and to properly appreciate the design process in all the fields it is applied in. IN reality, design is about learning from those who came before you, and thus this innate sense of history should be keenly developed. In turn, I hope that my career leads to solutions that grab people's attention in the same way that other people's creations centered themselves in my childhood. But until then, it is time to watch and make what I can - if only for other other like-minded patrons.
